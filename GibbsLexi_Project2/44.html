	Living with anxiety is like being followed by a voice.
	It knows all your insecurities and uses them against you.
	It gets to the point where it's the loudest voice in the room.
	The only one you can hear.
	It makes it hard to communicate.
	It makes you angry.
	It makes you lose focus.
	It makes you avoid things.
	It makes you negative.
	It makes you over think things.
	And it makes it difficult to sleep.
